# Mastering React Hooks

React Hooks revolutionized how we write React components by allowing us to use state and other React features in functional components. Let's explore the most important hooks and how to use them effectively.

## The Essential Hooks

### useState
The most basic hook for managing component state:

```jsx
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

const increment = () => setCount(count + 1);
```

### useEffect
Handle side effects in your components:

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  document.title = `Count: ${count}`;
}, [count]);
```

### useContext
Access React context without nesting:

```jsx
const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);
```

## Custom Hooks

One of the most powerful features is creating custom hooks to share logic:

```jsx
const useCounter = (initialValue = 0) => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(initialValue);
  
  const increment = () => setCount(c => c + 1);
  const decrement = () => setCount(c => c - 1);
  const reset = () => setCount(initialValue);
  
  return { count, increment, decrement, reset };
};
```

## Best Practices

1. **Follow the Rules of Hooks**: Only call hooks at the top level and only from React functions
2. **Use the dependency array correctly** in useEffect
3. **Extract custom hooks** when you find yourself repeating logic
4. **Use the right hook for the job** - don't overcomplicate with useEffect when useState is enough

Hooks make React code more reusable and easier to test. Once you master them, you'll wonder how you ever lived without them!
