# Cloud Migration and Infrastructure Modernization

Legacy systems can become a significant burden, limiting growth and innovation. At Nostos Labs, we specialize in migrating complex enterprise systems to modern cloud platforms, ensuring minimal disruption while maximizing benefits.

## Why Migrate to the Cloud?

### Cost Optimization
- Reduce infrastructure costs by 20-40%
- Eliminate hardware maintenance and upgrades
- Pay only for resources you actually use

### Enhanced Scalability
- Scale resources up or down based on demand
- Handle traffic spikes without performance degradation
- Global deployment in multiple regions

### Improved Security
- Enterprise-grade security built into cloud platforms
- Automated security updates and patches
- Advanced threat detection and response

## Our Migration Methodology

### 1. Assessment and Planning
We start with a comprehensive assessment of your current infrastructure:
- **Dependency Mapping**: Understand application interconnections
- **Performance Baseline**: Establish current performance metrics
- **Risk Analysis**: Identify potential migration challenges
- **Cost Modeling**: Project cloud costs vs. current expenses

### 2. Migration Strategy Selection
We choose the right approach for each application:
- **Rehosting (Lift & Shift)**: Quick migration with minimal changes
- **Replatforming**: Minor optimizations for cloud efficiency
- **Refactoring**: Comprehensive modernization for maximum benefits

### 3. Implementation Phases
- **Proof of Concept**: Validate approach with non-critical systems
- **Pilot Migration**: Migrate selected applications with full monitoring
- **Full Migration**: Execute complete migration plan
- **Optimization**: Fine-tune performance and costs
